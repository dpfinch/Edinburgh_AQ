This doesn't have anything in it yet.
It will have instructions at some point....
Here is some useful info:
  The data used by this program is CSV files from DEFRA.
  They are availble here:
  https://uk-air.defra.gov.uk/data/
  Currently uses the 'all measurements' variable from this website. Not sure
  how it'd work if you tried something else like 8-hour mean.
